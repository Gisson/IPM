This is a project of Person-Machine interface. The project is a watch-like device used in festivals. The project will be developed in html, javascript and css.

Introduction:

iRave is a device which purpose is to be used in festivals and concerts. It can be your ticket in and/or your ticket out, it can be used to talk to friends or even to order food and drinks.
We were purposed to develop the interface for this device in html, javascript and css.

Analysis of users and requirements:

We all got ideas to use in the system's interface and then we put those ideas on a questionnaire and handed it out to lots of people which were potencial future users of this devie.
This questionnaire can be found in the repository( Questionário AUT.txt).

Development:

After we got the results from the questionnaire we used preffered functionalities(by the users) and implemented them in the reffered languages. All of that implementation can be found in the folder Project.

Final report:

After developing the whole system we made a report of all our work and included there the users' manual. This file can be found at [IPM] Relatório Incremental.pdf

Any corrections or doubts talk to me.
